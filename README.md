## Choice Sourcing Challenge

~ The language is your choice.  
~ In a time frame you feel is adequate and aligns with your best work.  
~ Don't go too far down the rabbit hole on No.1

1. A server running a critical in-house application has just crashed and Windows has produced a mini dump. As a developer could you analyze the mini dump and provide as much data as you can to help the team have more information to decide the next steps.  
~ the dump is included in the repository (Mini121519-01.dmp)

2. Write an algorithm to flatten an arbitrarily nested array of integers. e.g. [ 1, [ 2, [ 3 ] ], 4 ] -> [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
